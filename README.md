Student Marks Card
==================

This project is a basic SpringBoot Application that displays Grade of
the student on taking marks as the input. It is coded in **Java** and
**HTML** and is build using **Maven**.

### How It Works

1.  It takes input of marks of three subjects- Physics, Chemistry and
    Maths. *(Yes it can accept decimal inputs too in the intervals of
    0.25)*
2.  Calculates the total of those three inputs and then calculates the
    average of the three marks from the total.
3.  Using Conditional Statements, it grades the student based on the
    average calulated.
4.  Finally it displays the individual subject marks, total marks and
    grade obtained in a tabular format.

### How to Run this project

1.  You'll have to run the
    **[StudentMarksApplication.java](StudentMarksApplication.java)**
    which will activate a localhost server and will give a 4 digit
    number **80xx** in the console.
2.  For viewing the HTML,

a.  Go to your browser and type `localhost:80xx/student-marks-card-html`
    in the address bar. This should open the first page of the app where
    you'll have to give the input.
b.  Once you press submit, you'll be shown the marks and grade in
    tabular format.

3.  For viewing the JSON,

a.  Make sure you have the **JSON Viewer** extension added to your
    browser.
b.  After that, type `localhost:8080/student-marks-card-json` in the
    address bar.
c.  You'll be able to see the program in JSON Format.
